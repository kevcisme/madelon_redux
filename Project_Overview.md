# Hello!


## Welcome to my Project. 

### Where to Start:
If you're here for the quick summary, head to ipynd/presentation.

### A note on the presentation slide deck:
I caution you that most of the code in the presentation notebook doesn't actually run. 
The presentation notebook is meant to give a high level overview of the project,
and any code in cell blocks is there for demonstration purposes.

### For those interested in code:
If you'd like to run code, head into the other notebooks from the ipynb folder.
