# Hello!


## Welcome to my Project. 

### Where to Start:
If you're here for the quick summary, head to ipynd > presentation.

### Cautions:
I caution you that most of the code in the presentation notebook doesn't actually run. 
The presentation notebook is meant to give a high level overview of the project,
and any code in cell blocks is there for demonstration purposes.

### For those interested in code:
If you'd like to run code, head into the other notebooks from the ipynb folder. 

## And finally, 
Everything runs as of 2017-05-11, so if you break it, you buy it. ;)
